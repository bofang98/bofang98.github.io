I am studying for a master's degree at [Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://www.iie.ac.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yuzhou). Before that, I received my B.E. degree in software engineering from [Xiamen University (XMU)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). I am interested in *video understanding*, typically in *video self-supervised representation learning* and *text-video cross-modal pretraining & retrieval*.

<p><font color="red">I will graduate in 2023 Fall, and am looking for a PhD or RA position, working on computer vision research and applications.</font></p>

\[News&#127752;\]
===
<p>&#127752; I am awarded with the national scholarship for postgraduate students (20,000 RMB).</p>
<p>&#127752; Three papers have been submitted to CVPR2023, focusing on text-video retrieval.</p>

<!-- Research Interests
======
My research is in the area of video-related vision tasks and video content understanding, with an emphasis on video self-supervised representation learning and text-video cross-modal retrieval. Meanwhile, I keep focused on contrastive self-supervised learning, vision base model developments, and large-scale (vision-language) pretraining, which can overall boost my research in videos. -->
