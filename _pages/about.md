Currently, I'm a new PhD student at Video, Image, and Sound Analysis Lab ([VISAL](http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk/)), City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Antoni B. Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/). Before that, I received my M.S. degree in [Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://www.iie.ac.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yuzhou), and B.E. degree in software engineering from [Xiamen University (XMU)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). I worked as a reasearch intern in VIS Baidu Inc from Sep. 2021, working closely with [Dr. Wenhao Wu](https://whwu95.github.io/). Also, I have maintained long-term cooperation with Dr. Chang Liu at Tsinghua University.

<!-- Research Interests
======
My research is in the area of video-related vision tasks and video content understanding, with an emphasis on video self-supervised representation learning and text-video cross-modal retrieval. Meanwhile, I keep focused on contrastive self-supervised learning, vision base model developments, and large-scale (vision-language) pretraining, which can overall boost my research in videos. -->
