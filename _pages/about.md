I am studying for a master's degree at [Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://www.iie.ac.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yuzhou). Before that, I received my B.E. degree in software engineering from [Xiamen University (XMU)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). I worked as a reasearch intern in VIS Baidu Inc from Sep. 2021, working closely with [Dr. Wenhao Wu](https://whwu95.github.io/). Also, I have maintained long-term cooperation with Dr. Chang Liu at Tsinghua University.

&#127752; News
===
&#128640; \[Nov, 2022\] I am awarded with the national scholarship for postgraduate students (20,000 RMB).

&#128640; \[Nov, 2022\] Two papers have been submitted to CVPR2023, focusing on text-video retrieval.

&#128640; \[Oct, 2022\] _MaMiCo_ has been selected as an oral presentation at MM'2022.

<!-- Research Interests
======
My research is in the area of video-related vision tasks and video content understanding, with an emphasis on video self-supervised representation learning and text-video cross-modal retrieval. Meanwhile, I keep focused on contrastive self-supervised learning, vision base model developments, and large-scale (vision-language) pretraining, which can overall boost my research in videos. -->
