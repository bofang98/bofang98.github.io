<!-- Research Interests
====== -->
My research is in the area of video-related vision tasks and video content understanding, with an emphasis on video self-supervised representation learning and text-video cross-modal retrieval. Meanwhile, I keep focused on contrastive self-supervised learning, vision base model developments, and large-scale (vision-language) pretraining, which can overall boost my research in videos.
